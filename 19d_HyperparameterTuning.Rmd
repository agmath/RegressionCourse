## Note: Unfinished Draft

This set of notes remains a work in progress. The following items remain to be completed.

+ Define and discuss hyperparameters
+ Using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters
+ Pay attention to the number of models you are trying to fit...
+ Space-filling grids versus sequential searches -- implement space-filling grids only here...
+ Show a single model with a single hyperparameter...
+ A single model with several hyperparameters...
+ A workflow set with multiple different hyperparameters from disparate recipes...
+ Introduce *racing* to speed up model selection???
