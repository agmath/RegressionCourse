The steps for installing R and RStudio are listed below, but detailed instructions follow for both Windows and Mac OS systems.

1. **Install R:** R is a computing language which has been optimized for use in statistics, data analytics, and data science.
2. **Install RStudio:** RStudio is a convenient way to interface with the R language. Think of R as "Spanish" and RStudio as Microsoft Word -- you can write R in RStudio, just like you can write Spanish text in Microsoft Word.

## 1. Installing R

Installing R is quite simple. Navigate to [CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} and choose the link corresponding to your operating system. Follow the instructions below corresponding to your operating system below. 

**Windows:**

+ Once the download completes, run the installer -- keep all of the default options.


**MACOS:**
