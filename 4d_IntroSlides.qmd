## A Good Viz Tells a Clear Story

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

p1 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = hwy, y = ..density..),
                 color = "black",
                 fill = "purple") +
  geom_density(aes(x = hwy),
               fill = "purple",
               alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Highway MPG",
       y = "")

p2 <- mpg %>%
  mutate(
    drv = case_when(
      drv == "f" ~ "Forward Drive",
      drv == "r" ~ "Rear Drive",
      TRUE ~ "Four Wheel"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = cty, y = drv, fill = drv),
               show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "City MPG",
       y = "")

p3 <- mpg %>%
  count(class) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(class, n), y = n)) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Count") + 
  coord_flip()

p4 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  labs(x = "City MPG", 
       y = "Highway MPG")

pwk <- (p3 + p1) / (p2 + p4)
pwk + plot_annotation(
  title = "Some Plots About Cars"
)
```

## A Bad Viz Doesn't

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

p1 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = displ)) + 
  labs(x = "Engine Displacement",
       y = "")

p2 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = class)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "")

p3 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = cty)) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "")

pwk <- p2 + (p1 / p3)
pwk + plot_annotation(
  title = "These Plots Stink!"
)
```

## Suggested Viz Choices

+ Single Numerical Variable

  + Histogram, Boxplot, or Density

+ Single Categorical Variable

  + Bar Graph

+ Two Numerical Variables

  + Scatterplot or Heatmap

+ Two Categorical Variables

  + Bar Graph with Fill Color or Heatmap

+ One Numerical and One Categorical Variable

  + Side-by-Side boxplots, overlayed or faceted histograms/densities
  
## Structure of a `ggplot()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4|1-4"

data %>% #the data to be plotted
  ggplot() + #initialize a plot
  geom_PLOT_TYPE(aes(...)) + #plot type and required mappings
  labs() #labels for plot
```

+ Note we can pipe (`%>%`) a data frame into a plot

  + We don't need a data frame though

+ Once we use `ggplot()` we use `+` to add layers instead of piping
+ `geom_*()` layers require *aesthetics* to map variables to plot features

  + Different *geoms* have different required/permitted aesthetics

+ Can add multiple *geoms* to a single plot
+ Every plot should include labels
+ Find [a `ggplot` cheatsheet here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf)

## Let's Do This!

1. Open RStudio
2. Check the top-right corner, next to the translucent blue box icon to verify that you are working in your `MAT300` project space

    + If you see `None` there instead of your project name, open your project by navigating to `File -> Open Project` or by using the dropdown menu near the project box
    
3. Open your Quarto Notebook from last time

4. Add some questions that you think could be answered using a data visualization and describe the relevant viz type

## Suggested Viz Choices, Revisited

+ Single Numerical Variable

  + `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_histogram()`, or `geom_density()`
  
    + Require `x` *or* `y` aesthetic (but not both!)
    + For example, `geom_density(aes(x = hwy))`
  
+ Single Categorical Variable

  + `geom_bar()`
  
    + Requires `x` *or* `y` aesthetic (but not both!)
    + For example, `geom_bar(aes(x = class))`
  
  + `geom_col()`
    
    + Can have both `x` and `y` aesthetic
    + Example, `geom_col(aes(x = class, y = n))`
    
## Suggested Viz Choices, Revisited

+ Two Numerical Variables

  + `geom_point()` or `geom_hexbin()`
  
    + Require both `x` *and* `y` aesthetic
    + For example, `geom_point(aes(x = cty, y = hwy))`
  
+ Two Categorical Variables

  + `geom_bar()`
  
    + Use `x` *and* `fill` aesthetics
    + For example, `geom_bar(aes(x = class, fill = drv))`

## Suggested Viz Choices, Revisited

+ One Numerical and One Categorical Variable

  + `geom_boxplot()`
  
    + Use both `x` and `y` aesthetics
    + For example, `geom_boxplot(aes(x = hwy, y = class))`
  
  + `geom_density()` or `geom_histogram()`
 
    + Use only `x` aesthetic
    + Add layer `facet_wrap(~ VAR_NAME)`

+ Other available *aesthetics* include `color`, `size`, `shape`, and `alpha` (transparency)

  + Remember, specific *geoms* permit only specific *aesthetics*

## On Labels

+ The `labs()` layer permits global plot labels and labels for any mapped aesthetic

  + `title`
  + `subtitle`
  + `caption`
  + `alt` (for alt-text)
  + `x`
  + `y`
  + `color`
  + `fill`
  + etc.

## Organizing Plots with `{patchwork}`

+ Often you'll want to arrange plots together, rather than printing them out one at a time
+ The `{patchwork}` package provides very easy and intuitive framework for doing this.

1. Create each of your plots, but store them into variables `p1`, `p2`, ...
2. Use `+` to organize plots side-by-side, and `/` to organize plots over/under one another.

    + For example, `(p1 + p2) / p3` will arrange plots `p1` and `p2` side-by-side, with plot `p3` underneath them.
    
## Try It!

. . . 

<center>

<font size="120pt"> <br/> $\bigstar$ Use `{patchwork}` to experiment with different arrangements of your plots</font>

</center>

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

## Additional Practice

1. Ask at least four more questions that can be answered using data visualization 

    + At least one *univiariate* question and at least one *multivariate* question
    + Add them to your notebook and describe why they are interesting questions
    
2. Construct relevant visuals (including meaningful labels) to answer your questions

    + Experiment with plot arrangements using `{patchwork}` if you like
    + Render your notebook to see the results when `{patchwork}` is used versus when it is not
    + Decide what you like better in this case

3. Provide interpretations of the plots you are seeing

. . .

**Reminder:** You have a fully complete notebook using the `penguins` data on the class webpage.

. . .

> In that notebook, I split the available data into *training* and *testing* sets -- we'll talk about why later on.
